This assembly program simulates a simple employee authentication system. It defines a list of 10 employee IDs and their corresponding passwords, which are encrypted using a custom bitwise encryption algorithm. When executed, the program repeatedly prompts the user to enter an employee ID. It searches the predefined list to check if the ID exists. If the ID is found, it then prompts for the employee's password (entered as a decimal number). If the password matches the one stored, it encrypts the password and grants access; otherwise, it denies access. If the ID is not found, it notifies the user. The program uses BIOS and DOS interrupts (INT 21h) for input/output operations and maintains user data in memory using .data segment declarations. Password encryption is performed using a combination of shifts and rotations, ensuring that even if a correct password is reused, it is always re-encrypted. The flow loops back after each attempt, allowing continuous login attempts without restarting the program.
